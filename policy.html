                <h4>HOW LONG DO WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</h4>
                <p>We will keep your personal information only as long as we consider it necessary to fulfill our
                    purposes as described above under “Why do we process your personal information”. Then we will delete
                    or, in some cases, anonymize your personal information. We regularly check whether we have saved
                    personal information to be deleted. Since we process your personal information for different
                    purposes, the actual period of personal information will vary.
                    Typically, the following deletion deadlines apply:

                <h4>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h4>
                <p>Protecting your personal information is important to us. All personal information you provide us is
                    stored on secure servers and we have strict procedures to protect against loss, abuse, unauthorized
                    access, change, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. Any payment transactions
                    will be encrypted by industry standard technology and subject to PCI security standards.
                    While we work hard to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee that our security measures
                    prevent any unauthorized attempts to access, use or disclose personal information. However, we
                    maintain safety and incident plans, including plans for handling any breach of data security, in
                    case of a physical or technical incident to handle this in a timely fashion and limit any adverse
                    effect of such an incident.
                </p>
                <h4>HOW CAN YOU ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h4>
                <p class="zeroMargin">We understand that sometimes you may need additional information from us about
                    your personal information and how they are processed or that you may want to update or correct the
                    personal information you have given us. Therefore, you include the following rights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Right to access your personal information: You are entitled to be verified by us if we process
                        personal information about you and, if so, to access your personal information and information.
                    </li>
                    <li>- Right to get corrected personal information: If you find that personal information we treat
                        about
                        you is inaccurate, you have the right to make us correct such personally identifiable
                        information.</li>
                    <li> - Right to delete personal information (the right to be forgotten): Under certain
                        circumstances, for
                        example, if your personal information has been processed illegally or you have withdrawn your
                        consent (if processing of your personal information is based on your consent), you have the
                        right to
                        request and delete your personal information from us.</li>
                    <li>- Right to limit processing: under certain circumstances, i.e. If you contest the accuracy of
                        your
                        personal information or if you object to our legitimate purpose to process your personal
                        information, you are entitled to request that we limit the processing of your personal
                        information
                        until a solution has been found.</li>
                    <li>- Right to protest against processing: under certain circumstances, i.e. if you contest our
                        legitimate interest in processing your personal information, you have the right to object, for
                        reasons relating to your particular situation, against such processing.</li>
                    <li>- Right to data portability: If your personal information is processed automatically based on
                        your
                        consent or in the performance of our contractual relationship, you have the right to request
                        that we
                        provide you with your personal information in a machine-readable format for transmission to
                        another
                        data controller.</li>
                    <li>- Right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority: You have the right to file a
                        complaint
                        regarding our processing of your personal information to your supervisory authority.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If our processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you have the right to
                    withdraw such consent at any time (however, it will not affect processing based on your consent
                    before withdrawal) by contacting us or by updating the settings in the Service. <br />
                    (where relevant).<br />
                    Please contact us using the contact details below to make a request for your rights. We will make
                    commercially reasonable efforts to respond to your request within 30 days of receiving such a
                    request. If we cannot comply with your request within 30 days, we will let you know about this, the
                    reason for the delay and when we expect to be able to meet your request.<br />
                    Also, be aware that you can change your contact preferences on the “Settings” page if you do not
                    want to receive certain types of information from us. You can also do this at any time by contacting

                    versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
